This repository contains the HPC QNorm trials.

Register with github.com and ask ots to add you to the project.

Learn to use git following the instructions on github - see
http://github.com/guides/home. The simplest instruction is to clone the
repository:

  git clone git@github.com:ots/qnormalization.git

Windows users have to give this command (first):

  git config --global core.autocrlf true

Next hack, hack. 'pull' other people's updates, 'commit' changes and 'push'
them to github. The last requires the creation of an ssh key. See the
instructions on github.
